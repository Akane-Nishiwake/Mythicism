This project was made in collaboration with my classmates in the spring/summer of 2022 for our Final Project at Full Sail University. You can read more about the project here https://arcanestudios.itch.io/mythicism as well as test out the game itself.
I personally worked on Game play mechanics, VFX, SFX, UI, and UX for this project.
 
My teammates were:

The reason this is here is because our original repository was on a school ran private repo and I wished to have our work public for everyone to see even though it has been a few years since we wrapped up with school.
